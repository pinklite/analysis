demo notes

Data:
 1. Dates are stored in different format
 	a. Abbreviated dates in CSV
 	b. MovieLens uses dashed format (1894-11-6)
 2. Names mess up JSON parsing
 	a. Often, they have apostrophes in them (O'Connell, D'Servi, L'Sheev, Mark 'Spark' Robins)
 3. Columns have missing values
 	a. Merging datasets is hard because sometimes rows have `null` in common
 	b. We're pulling from 3 different databases (IMDb, TMDb, and MovieLens)
 4. Redundancy is good.
 	a. Since we have a supreme overlord database,
 	     i.	The issue with TMDb not returning what they promise they would 
 	    ii.	We might become too dependent. There are problems with the data that are untenably hard to remedy
 	   iii. What do we do about missing values? That's where open source falls short.
 	    iv. But there are solutions: VarietyInsight
 	b. Since we are relying on old data, this is where we're reaching the cusp.

 - personalized bags in teh french orphanage
 - kids and even neighborhood patrons resisted the demonstration (it was political and aimed as a fundraiser)
 - none of the kids even wnted to be there. they wanted to be in jerusalem
 - kids turned their backs until someone got onstage and announced himeself
 - everyong turned around to see him because they knew who he was. 
 - the man broke down and everyone started crying
 - someone got onstage and said that that was such a gift. nobody had been able to cry
 	- that someone's father was killed in front of him by an SS officer, and he didn't cry to give that man the satsifaction
 	- then he couldn't cry after that, because how could he if he didn't cry when his father was murdered?
 - but in that moment he was able to 
 - that personalization of the bags as gifts almost convinced the students to come out (material identification)


notes from Lee:

 - Like to see what countries are featured
 - like to see the production babies
 - like to see the amount of VFX people (especially surprised to learn that there's special FX at all at times)
 - Likes to know the songs 
 - Imagines some sort of tool to analyze the credits themselves and provide insight in real time
